Love me in the in between
On my way to being the full being I am meant to be
For me and for the future we
And all the me's that I have been
The dreams that come to tell me of the path that lies ahead
The things that I must leave behind instead of me for dead
The parts that have finally reached their dead end
And at the end of it all
There always seems to be some more
To dig up and through
But that is what we do
We live and are alive
While we learn to survive and then thrive in this life
Cut open the pieces buried deepest inside
To let out the pieces that still try to find their place to hide
In our lungs and our hearts that have stung for so long
We've become accustomed to being this numb
And this hung up on all of the potential
Instead of the truth
It's all monumental and accidental in truth
And only as instrumental and detrimental as you allow it to be
Can't allow ourselves to be used
I wade in the waters of the in between
Until I'm born again, anew and renewed
Leave me, leave me in the in between
Love me, love me in the in between, oh
