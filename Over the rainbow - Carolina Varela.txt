over the rainbow

'Kay, this one's for Gabby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true, ooh-ooh
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops, that's where
You'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dream that you dare to
Oh, why, oh, why can't I?
Well, I see trees of green and
Red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for
Me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Well, I see skies of blue and I see
Clouds of white
And the brightness of day
Highlight the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I, I love you"
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world, world
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where
You'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dream that you dare to
Why, oh, why can't I?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
