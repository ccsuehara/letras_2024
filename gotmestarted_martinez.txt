[Verse 1]
He's got the personality not even gravity could ever hold him down
He's got the sexuality of a man who can take a room and drown it out
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Inching closer to sunrise
Now we're standin' eye to eye
I wanna tell you what's on my—
On my mind (Let's go)

[Chorus]
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe

[Verse 2]
We've got that hot chemistry, yeah, you and me won't make it out this house
We should experiment even to the detriment of whoever's on the couch (Oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Inching closer to sunrise
Now we're layin' side by side
I wanna tell you what's on my— (Yeah)
On my mind

[Chorus]
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe
Oh, baby, baby




[Bridge]
Boy, can I be honest?
Boy, can I be honest?
Yeah
We got somethin' to give each other


You just, you just, you just, you just (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright? (Alright?)
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby (Yeah)

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
We got somethin' to give each other
