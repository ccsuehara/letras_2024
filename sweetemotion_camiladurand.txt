She's the woman that's on your mind
She's the woman who takes her time
She's the woman that's on your mind
She's the woman who takes her time

Yes, I feel sweet emotion
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near
I said I feel sweet emotion
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near

I said I feel sweet emotion
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near
And I feel like your creation
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near

'Cause she's the woman that's on my mind
She's the woman who takes my time
She's the woman that's on my mind
She's the woman that's on my mind

I said I feel sweet emotion
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near
And I feel sweet sensation
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near

And I feel vibration
What are your expectations?
Baby, I don't have no fear

(Sweet emotions, I feel sweet emotions)
'Cause she's the woman that's on my mind
She's the woman who takes my time
She's the woman that's on my mind
She's the woman that's on my mind
Yes she is

Yes, I feel sweet emotion
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near
And I feel sweet sensation
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near

I said I feel sweet emotion
Everytime you're near me
Everytime you are near
Excuse me if I seem audacious
But you're just so flirtatious
I just need you here
